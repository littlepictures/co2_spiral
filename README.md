# little picture - co2 spiral

## Background on this CLIP
The amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is increasing, largely due to the burning of fossil fuels. 

This seasonal plot (or rose diagram) shows the monthly average concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere over European countries, measured by satellite, from 2014 (light blue) to 2020 (dark red). The concentration has been above 400 parts per million (ppm) since September 2016. The plot is asymmetric, due to the absorption of carbon dioxide by growing plants in the summer months.

## Data Sources
The CLIP uses the following datasets:
Column averaged carbon dioxide from OCO-2 generated with the FOCAL algorithm, version 10
- https://github.com/littlepictures/datasets/commit/62aefa2839cb624d31d3dbe17d33d1308c42c60f
- https://catalogue.ceda.ac.uk/uuid/070522ac6a5d4973a95c544beef714b4

## Data Preparation
The monthly CO2 values for all European countries were averaged in Excel, then split into years (data file CO2-Europe-2014-2020-radarplot.csv). 

## Creating Visualisations
This file was plotted as a polar chart in Flourish (omitting the final incomplete year):

The lines were published as an image with and without the grid, then the line colours were filled to solid areas in Photoshop.
